<h3>COMP 2909 - Angular and Vue.js Fundamentals</h3>
This hands-on course follows on from COMP 1850 and COMP 2015 and is aimed at students who <br>
already understand how to build web pages with HMTL, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. <br>
Angular is a popular JavaScript-based, open-source front-end application framework designed to <br>
address the challenges of developing modularized single-page applications.<br>
Vue.js is a newer open-source framework based on JavaScript that was designed for building user interfaces.<br>
Vue.js functions like Angular to rapidly modularize application development.<br>
Participants first learn Angular development fundamentals and then practice building components,<br>
modules, and services for data-driven, client-side web applications.<br>
Exercises also include: routing, asynchronous JSON transfer, and validation.<br>
These features are then implemented using Vue.js. <br>
Automated testing and redux architecture are also introduced using Angular.<br>
As well, there is a brief introduction to using Angular with the Apache Cordova framework<br>
for platform independent mobile development for Android and iOS.<br>
Upon successful completion students will have experience using these rich JavaScript frameworks<br>
to develop data-driven and interactive single-page web applications for all mainstream browsers.
